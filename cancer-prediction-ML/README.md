# Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the recurrence of breast cancer in patients. The dataset used contains variables such as age, degree of malignancy, tumor size, and others. Various supervised learning techniques are used to create ML models to predict whether a patient will have recurrent breast cancer. The models focus on minimizing false negatives to ensure high recall, recognizing the  importance of accurately identifying potential recurrences.

## Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.

- K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN): A non-parametric method that classifies cases based on their similarity to other instances.

- Logistic Regression: A statistical model that estimates probabilities using a logistic function.
