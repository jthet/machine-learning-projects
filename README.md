## Project 1: [Fuel Efficiency Prediction (Linear Regression)](https://github.com/jthet/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/linear-regression-ML)

The project focuses on applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to predict car fuel efficiency. It uses various Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for model implementation.

## Project 2: [Cancer Predictions (Classification)](https://github.com/jthet/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/cancer-prediction-ML)

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the recurrence of breast cancer in patients. The dataset used contains variables such as age, degree of malignancy, tumor size, and others. Various supervised learning techniques are used to create ML models to predict whether a patient will have recurrent breast cancer. The models focus on minimizing false negatives to ensure high recall, recognizing the importance of accurately identifying potential recurrences.
